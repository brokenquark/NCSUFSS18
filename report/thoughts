variance
tuning stability
cvfdt
distribution change
cross valiadation
optimized code of vfdt
for all test, do with proper mutation
evolution algorithm parameters
how much imporvement is possible over normal run and mutated run
mean and sd of recall
reaching hoefding bound
best mutated solution should be done in sets but we hv got points
