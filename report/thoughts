variance
tuning stability
cvfdt
distribution change
cross valiadation
optimized code of vfdt
for all test, do with proper mutation
evolution algorithm parameters
how much imporvement is possible over normal run and mutated run
mean and sd of recall
reaching hoefding bound
best mutated solution should be done in sets but we hv got points
imbalanced data
show data on robustness
does feature selection has any impact
ratio of tp fp fn tn
multi objective optimization
show how much improvement has been done after applying DE
look for threats to validity section in 
    bellweather
    better data vs better data miner
de random seed bias + iteration count
